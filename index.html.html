            <p>I am a associate at amazon and I am currently enrolled in Web Development with Correlation one through career choice. I started this page for people to get to know me and follow me. Also, if you would like to contact me for anything like to talk, advice, or any type of help I can do. I have included a form for anyone. Please take your time and fill it out with your name and your concern if you would like, and I will get back to you. You can find me on Youtube or Linkedin as of now. I will continue to add more of my links soon.<br><br>
            
            Starting out as a student of C1's software development program I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into I just knew i was on the right track of something better for my life. I have learned so much in the past month creating a web page to designing a web page and this is just the beginning I feel. I enjoy the instructors, TA's, CSC's, and my fellows so much its like everyone is so nice, helpful, and ready to learn. I am on a journey to reach honors in this program and when September 1st comes I will be waiting to show and tell everyone I did it. but till then I will work as hard as I always do and you can follow me below for any questions or to follow my journey </p>
